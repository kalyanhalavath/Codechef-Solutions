For English :
Reverse the strings given and pair the ith character with the n-i-1th character. 
Then construct a trie for all strings. Then do a dfs on the trie. 
Ans += ((x + y)/2) * depth^2
X is the number of strings ending at the node.
Y is the number of children with odd number of endings in the subtree.
